## Key Preevy Components

### 1. Docker Configuration
The application is containerized for consistent deployment across environments.

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflows
- **preevy-up.yml**: Deploys preview environments on PR events
- **preevy-down.yml**: Cleans up environments when PRs are closed

### 3. Google Cloud Platform Integration
- Service account authentication for cloud resource management
- Dynamic provisioning of compute resources per preview environment

### 4. Docker Compose Service Definition
- Defines the application stack for Preevy to deploy

## Docker Configuration Deep Dive

### Dockerfile Analysis

The `Dockerfile` implements a **multi-stage build** optimized for Preevy deployments:

```dockerfile
# ---- Build stage ----
FROM node:22-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# ---- Runtime stage ----
FROM node:22-alpine
WORKDIR /app
RUN npm i -g serve
COPY --from=build /app/dist ./dist

# Run as non-root user
RUN chown -R node:node /app
USER node

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["serve", "-s", "dist", "-l", "3000"]
```

#### Key Design Decisions for Preevy:

1. **Multi-stage Build**: Reduces final image size by excluding build dependencies
2. **Alpine Linux**: Minimal base image for faster deployments
3. **Non-root User**: Security best practice for cloud deployments
4. **Static File Serving**: Uses `serve` package for production-ready static hosting
5. **Port 3000**: Standardized port that Preevy can reliably expose

#### Docker Compose Configuration

```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    restart: always
    networks: [appnet]

networks:
  appnet: {}
```

- **Restart Policy**: Ensures service availability in cloud environments
- **Network Isolation**: Creates dedicated network for the service
- **Port Mapping**: Exposes application on port 3000 for Preevy URL generation

## Google Cloud Platform Setup for Preevy

### Prerequisites
To run this Preevy demo, you need:

1. **Google Cloud Project** with billing enabled
2. **Service Account** with appropriate permissions
3. **Preevy Profile** configured for GCP

### Required GCP Permissions

The service account used by Preevy needs these IAM roles:
- `Compute Engine Admin` - For creating/managing VM instances
- `Compute Network Admin` - For VPC and firewall management
- `Cloud Build Editor` - For container image building (if needed)
- `Storage Admin` - For storing Preevy state and logs

### Service Account Setup

#### Using Google Cloud Console (Recommended)

1. **Navigate to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts** in the Google Cloud Console
2. **Click "Create Service Account"**
3. **Enter Service Account Details**:
   - Name: `preevy-sa` (or your preferred name)
   - Description: "Service account for Preevy deployments"
   - Click "Create and Continue"

4. **Assign Required Roles**:
   - Add `Compute Engine Admin` role
   - Add `Compute Network Admin` role
   - Add `Storage Admin` role (for Preevy state storage)
   - Click "Continue"

5. **Create and Download Key**:
   - Click "Create Key"
   - Select "JSON" format
   - Download the key file (save as `preevy-sa-key.json`)
   - Store securely and add to GitHub secrets

#### Alternative: CLI Setup
You can also create the service account using the `gcloud` CLI if you prefer command-line tools.

### Preevy Profile Configuration

This demo uses a Preevy profile stored in Google Cloud Storage, created and managed through the Preevy CLI.

#### Creating the Profile

1. **Install Preevy CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g preevy
   ```

2. **Initialize Profile**:
   ```bash
   preevy profile create gce my-profile --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID
   ```

3. **Configure Profile Settings**:
   The CLI will prompt you to configure:
   - **Machine Type**: e2-micro (for demo) or larger for production workloads
   - **Zone**: us-central1-a (or your preferred zone)
   - **Network**: default VPC or custom network
   - **Storage Options**: Profile stored in GCS bucket

4. **Upload Profile to Cloud Storage**:
   The profile is automatically stored in a GCS bucket and a URL is generated for access.

#### Profile Storage in GCS

- Preevy creates a dedicated GCS bucket for profile storage
- The profile URL format: `gs://preevy-profiles-[hash]/[profile-name].json`
- This URL is used in the `PREEVY_PROFILE_URL` GitHub variable
- Benefits:
  - **Centralized**: Accessible from any CI/CD environment
  - **Secure**: Uses GCP IAM for access control
  - **Versioned**: Profile changes are tracked
  - **Shared**: Multiple team members can use the same profile

#### Key Profile Settings for This Demo

The profile typically includes:
- **Driver**: `gce` (Google Compute Engine)
- **Machine Type**: `e2-micro` (cost-effective for demos)
- **Boot Disk**: 20GB persistent disk
- **Network**: Default VPC with automatic firewall rules
- **Labels**: Environment tags for resource management

### GitHub Secrets Configuration

Add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

| Secret Name | Description | Value |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| `PREEVY_SA_KEY` | GCP service account key | Contents of `preevy-sa-key.json` |

### GitHub Variables Configuration

Add these variables to your GitHub repository:

| Variable Name | Description | Value |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| `PREEVY_PROFILE_URL` | Preevy profile configuration | URL to your profile config |

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### Preevy Up Workflow (`preevy-up.yml`)

This workflow creates preview environments when PRs are opened, reopened, or updated:

```yaml
name: Deploy Preevy environment
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - reopened
      - synchronize
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
concurrency: preevy-${{ github.event.number }}
```

#### Key Components:

1. **Trigger Events**:
   - `opened`: New PR created
   - `reopened`: Closed PR reopened
   - `synchronize`: New commits pushed to PR

2. **Permissions**:
   - `id-token: write`: For OIDC authentication with GCP
   - `pull-requests: write`: To post preview URLs as comments

3. **Concurrency Control**:
   - Ensures only one deployment per PR runs at a time
   - Cancels previous runs if new commits are pushed

4. **Environment Configuration**:
   ```yaml
   environment:
     name: pr-${{ github.event.number }}
     url: ${{ fromJson(steps.preevy_up.outputs.urls-map).frontend[3000] }}
   ```
   - Creates GitHub environment named after PR number
   - Dynamically sets environment URL from Preevy output

5. **GCP Authentication**:
   ```yaml
   - name: 'Authenticate to Google Cloud'
     uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v1'
     with:
       credentials_json: '${{ secrets.PREEVY_SA_KEY }}'
   ```

6. **Preevy Deployment**:
   ```yaml
   - uses: livecycle/preevy-up-action@v2.4.0
     id: preevy_up
     with:
       install: gh-release
       profile-url: ${{ vars.PREEVY_PROFILE_URL }}
   ```

7. **Dashboard Integration**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Send build metadata to public API
     env:
       PR_ID: ${{ github.event.pull_request.id }}
       PR_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.number }}
       REPO: ${{ github.repository }}
       SHA: ${{ github.sha }}
       ACTOR: ${{ github.actor }}
       FRONTEND_URL: ${{ fromJson(steps.preevy_up.outputs.urls-map).frontend[3000] }}
     run: |
       payload=$(
         jq -n \
           --arg id "preevy-$PR_ID" \
           --arg repo "$REPO" \
           --arg pr "$PR_NUMBER" \
           --arg sha "$SHA" \
           --arg branch "${{ github.ref_name || github.ref }}" \
           --arg actor "$ACTOR" \
           --arg frontend "$FRONTEND_URL" \
           '{build_id:$id, repo:$repo, pr_number:($pr|tonumber), commit_sha:$sha, branch:$branch, actor:$actor, frontend_url:$frontend, status:"ready"}'
       )

       curl -sS -X POST "https://preevy-preview-manager.vercel.app/api/previews" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d "$payload"
   ```

   This step sends metadata about the deployed preview environment to a centralized dashboard, including:
   - **Build ID**: Unique identifier combining "preevy-" and PR ID
   - **Repository Info**: Repository name and branch
   - **PR Details**: PR number, commit SHA, and actor
   - **Preview URL**: The live environment URL from Preevy
   - **Status**: Deployment status ("ready")

### Preevy Down Workflow (`preevy-down.yml`)

This workflow cleans up preview environments when PRs are closed:

```yaml
name: Teardown Preevy environment
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - closed
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read
concurrency: preevy-${{ github.event.number }}
```

#### Key Components:

1. **Cleanup Process**:
   ```yaml
   - uses: livecycle/preevy-down-action@v1.4.0
     with:
       profile-url: ${{ vars.PREEVY_PROFILE_URL }}
       install: gh-release
       args: '--force'
   ```
   - `--force`: Ensures environment is torn down even if errors occur
   - Removes GCP resources (VMs, networks, storage)
   - Cleans up Preevy state

2. **Dashboard Cleanup**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Mark preview as down in dashboard
     env:
       PR_ID: ${{ github.event.pull_request.id }}
     run: |
       payload=$(
         jq -n \
           --arg id "preevy-$PR_ID" \
           '{build_id:$id, status:"down"}'
       )

       curl -sS -X PATCH "https://preevy-preview-manager.vercel.app/api/previews" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d "$payload"
   ```
   - Updates the dashboard to mark the preview environment as "down"
   - Uses the same build ID format for consistency
   - Ensures dashboard reflects current state of environments

### Workflow Benefits

1. **Cost Optimization**: Automatic cleanup prevents resource waste
2. **Isolation**: Each PR gets its own environment
3. **Fast Feedback**: Developers see changes in live environment
4. **Security**: Proper authentication and permission scoping
5. **Centralized Monitoring**: Dashboard integration provides unified view of all preview environments
6. **State Tracking**: Real-time status updates for deployment lifecycle

## Vercel Dashboard Integration

This demo includes integration with a centralized preview environment dashboard hosted on Vercel (`https://preevy-preview-manager.vercel.app`). This dashboard provides a unified view of all active preview environments across repositories.

### Dashboard Features

- **Real-time Status**: Track deployment status of all preview environments
- **Metadata Collection**: Repository, PR number, commit SHA, branch, and actor information
- **Environment URLs**: Direct links to preview environments
- **Lifecycle Management**: Automatic status updates from "ready" to "down"

### API Integration

#### Preview Creation (POST `/api/previews`)
When a preview environment is deployed, the workflow sends:

```json
{
  "build_id": "preevy-{PR_ID}",
  "repo": "owner/repo-name",
  "pr_number": 123,
  "commit_sha": "abc123...",
  "branch": "feature-branch",
  "actor": "username",
  "frontend_url": "https://preview-url.preevy.dev",
  "status": "ready"
}
```

#### Preview Cleanup (PATCH `/api/previews`)
When a PR is closed, the workflow updates:

```json
{
  "build_id": "preevy-{PR_ID}",
  "status": "down"
}
```

### Benefits of Dashboard Integration

1. **Centralized Monitoring**: Single view of all preview environments
2. **Team Visibility**: Stakeholders can easily find and access preview environments
3. **Resource Tracking**: Monitor environment lifecycle and usage patterns
4. **Historical Data**: Track deployment frequency and patterns
5. **Integration Ready**: API endpoints can be consumed by other tools

## Preevy Deployment Flow

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **PR Creation/Update**
   - Developer creates PR or pushes new commits
   - GitHub webhook triggers `preevy-up.yml` workflow

2. **Environment Preparation**
   - GitHub Actions authenticates with GCP using service account
   - Preevy reads profile configuration
   - Determines resource requirements

3. **Infrastructure Provisioning**
   - Preevy creates GCP VM instance
   - Sets up networking and firewall rules
   - Configures Docker environment on VM

4. **Application Deployment**
   - Docker image is built from repository
   - Container is deployed to provisioned VM
   - Service is exposed via generated URL

5. **Notification & Dashboard Update**
   - Preview URL is posted to PR as comment
   - GitHub environment is updated with URL
   - Deployment status is reported
   - **Dashboard Integration**: Preview metadata is sent to centralized dashboard for monitoring

6. **Cleanup (PR Closure)**
   - `preevy-down.yml` workflow triggered
   - All GCP resources are destroyed
   - **Dashboard Status Update**: Preview marked as "down" in dashboard
   - Costs stop accumulating immediately

### Preview Environment Features

- **Unique URLs**: Each PR gets a distinct subdomain
